              To the right is an image showing shipments of penicillin and other life-saving medical supplies being unloaded from a plane for the soldiers on the front lines during World War II. This image captures a crucial part of the war in the logistics of wartime medicine, showing the tactics medicine adds to the war. Penicillin, which had only recently been mass-produced for human use, played a transformative role in reducing infection-related deaths and improving survival rates, this photograph not only reflects the advancement of medical science but also shows the immense effort involved in transporting essential supplies under the pressure of the enemy and being strategic about shipments.
