              To the <b>right</b> is a box of Bicillin, a commercial form of benzathine penicillin that was widely used during the Vietnam War. Bicillin provided a long-acting dose of penicillin, typically administered through intramuscular injection, making it particularly useful in treating bacterial infections in field conditions where ongoing medical access was limited. Its extended-release formulation allowed for sustained antibiotic coverage with fewer doses, which was crucial in combat zones. The presence of such medications illustrates the evolution of antibiotic delivery and the importance of effective, portable treatments in modern warfare, where infection control remained a vital component of soldier survival and recovery.

              To the <b>left</b> is an image taken in Vietnam on January 21, 1971, showing a Marine Staff Sergeant attempting to subdue a bull as part of a humanitarian medical effort. The bull, suffering from pneumonia, was one of many animals being treated during a Civic Action Program (Civic-CAP) in the village of Hoa Tho. The Marine, identified as Staff Sergeant O. L. Barritt, was thrown by the bull while trying to wrestle it down so it could be administered a shot of penicillin by a Navy hospital corpsman. This scene highlights the broad use of penicillin—not only for soldiers but also for livestock critical to local recovery efforts—and reflects the complex role of military personnel in both combat and humanitarian operations.
